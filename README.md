## HEARTSYNC
This case study examines how data-driven analytics can enhance **HeartSync**, a global dating platform.
As the data analyst, I developed an interactive **Power BI dashboard suite** that consolidates insights across five key areas: user demographics, engagement behavior, matching & conversations, premium monetization, and safety reporting.
The dashboards provide a holistic understanding of how users interact with the app, what drives successful matches, and where opportunities exist to improve platform performance.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project analyzes simulated user activity from HeartSync, a modern dating platform. The dataset includes detailed records on user profiles, demographics, swipe behavior, session activity, match generation, conversation trends, subscription tiers, and safety reports.

The dashboard is organized into five analytical sections:

1. User Demographics – A complete breakdown of the community: age groups, gender identity, geography, and relationship intentions.
2. User Engagement – Insights into how frequently users log in, how long they stay active, how much they swipe, and differences between app versions.
3. Matching & Conversation – Evaluation of match volume, match quality, messaging patterns, and engagement differences across age groups and goals.
4. Premium Monetization – Analysis of subscription tiers, revenue contributions, conversion patterns, and outcomes for premium vs free users.
5. Safety & Reporting – Overview of user reports, types of incidents, reporting frequency by demographics, and potential risk indicators.

Each dashboard page was designed to help product teams understand user behavior, identify growth opportunities, and improve platform experience.
